# 📘 Algorithms & Data Structures  
A curated collection of implementations, notes, and examples in C and Markdown.

This repository is part of an ongoing study and documentation effort to master **core algorithms**, **data structures**, and **programming fundamentals**.  
Each topic includes both **conceptual explanations** (`.md` files) and **practical C implementations** (`.c` files).

# 🧠 Purpose of This Repository

This project serves as:

- A **learning journal** for mastering algorithms and data structures  
- A **reference library** of clean, well‑documented C implementations  
- A **teaching resource** for explaining concepts clearly  
- A **foundation** for future advanced topics (AVL, Red‑Black Trees, Graph Algorithms, etc.)

---

# 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. Start with **Programming_Fundamentals.md**  
2. Move through each data structure in order  
3. Read the `.md` file for theory  
4. Study the `.c` file for implementation  
5. Experiment, modify, and extend the code  
6. Use this as a base for interview prep or academic study

---

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C Programming Language**  
- Markdown for documentation  
- GCC / Clang for compilation  
- Git for version control

---

# 📈 Future Additions (Planned)

- Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort)  
- Advanced trees (AVL, Red‑Black Trees, Tries)
