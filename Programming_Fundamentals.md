# Programming Fundamentals

## Algorithms and Data Structures

- **Reference book:** *A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms* (Jay Wengrow)
- I will not cover basic programming concepts here. For those topics, please refer to standard C, C++, or Python textbooks. After that, you may explore my **Modern C++** GitHub repository.
- I assume the reader already has a solid understanding of programming and embedded systems. The focus here will be on the most important concepts.
